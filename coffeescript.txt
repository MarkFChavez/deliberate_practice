COFFEESCRIPT
===================================================================

a programming language that compiles into javascript
syntax derived from ruby and python
created and maintained by jeremy ashkenas
syntax: clean and minimal
semicolons are not required
parenthesis are usually not required
curly braces are usually not required
commas are sometimes not required
uses indentation instead of {}
example:
    my_function = ->
          alert “hello world” #take note of the indentation

          creating a method
            hello_world = ->
                alert “hello world”

                creating a method with argument
                  sum = (first, second) ->
                      first  + second

                      creating an object
                        bill = 
                            name: “Mark”
                                age: 18

                                In coffeescript, == is often replaced by ‘is’ (coffee script way)
                                Private methods in coffee script starts with ‘_’ (underscore)
                                the @ symbol means that it is an instance variable/method
                                Class example:
                                    class Value
                                          constructor: (@number) ->
                                              
                                                    map: ->
                                                            if @_is_fizzbuzz()

                                                            heredoc syntax for coffeescript. use an identifier like so
                                                            for example: name = ‘’’ this is my name ‘’’ #multiline

                                                            Avoid comments as possible
                                                            # for single line comment
                                                            ### this is a comment ### for multiline comment

                                                            Assigning multiple variables in one line
                                                            [a, b] = [1, 2]
                                                            also works with nested arrays
                                                            [a, [b, c], d] = [10, [5, 5], 30]
                                                            it also works with objects!
                                                            { name, address } = { name: “Mark”, address: “Philippines” }

                                                            Blocks in coffeescript (no curly braces required). Indentation is very important
                                                              if condition
                                                                  #some block
                                                                    else
                                                                        #another block

                                                                        if, else, unless are examples of conditionals
                                                                        you can use a one-liner
                                                                        example: say_hello() if condition
                                                                        there is no ternary operator in coffee script but here’s a workaround.
                                                                        account_colour = if balance < 0 then ‘red’ else ‘black’

                                                                        You can also do chained comparisons
                                                                        (a < b < c) - this will evaluate to (a < b && b < c)

                                                                        Loops
